# User Search browser navigation

## Description

As a user, I want to see the results for my previous search when using the browser's back button to return to the user search screen from the view user screen.

## Assumptions

* Normal search functionality is already implemented - this is an enhancement

## Acceptance Criteria 

1. After clicking on the view user icon from the user search, the user can then click on the browser's back button to return to the user search screen 
2. Upon returning to the user search screen using the browser's back button, the user will see the same search results as they did before clicking the view icon
